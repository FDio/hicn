## Executables ##

The utility applications are a set of binary executables that are used to run a clinet/server ping applications (hicn-ping-server and hicn-ping-client) and a hicn implementation of hicn (hiperf).

### hicn-ping-server ###

The command `hicn-ping-server` runs the server side ping application. hicn-ping-server can be executed
with the following options:

```
usage: hicn-ping-server [options]

Options:
-s <content_size>           = object content size (default 1350B)
-n <hicn_name>              = hicn name (default b001::/64)
-f                          = set tcp flags according to the flag received (default false)
-l <lifetime>               = data lifetime
-r                          = always reply with a reset flag (default false)
-t <ttl>                    = set ttl (default 64)
-V                          = verbose, prints statistics about the messagges sent and received (default false)
-D                          = dump, dumps sent and received packets (default false)
-q                          = quite, not prints (default false)
-d                          = daemon mode
-H                          = help
```

### hicn-ping-client ###

The command `hicn-ping-client` runs the client side ping application. hicn-ping-client can be executed
with the following options:

```
usage: hicn-ping-client [options]

Options:
-i <ping_interval>          = ping interval in microseconds (default 1000000ms)
-m <max_pings>              = maximum number of pings to send (default 10)
-s <source_port>            = source port (default 9695)
-d <destination_port>       = destination port (default 8080)
-t <ttl>                    = set packet ttl (default 64)
-O                          = open tcp connection (three way handshake) (default false)
-S                          = send always syn messages (default false)
-A                          = send always ack messages (default false)
-n <hicn_name>              = hicn name (default b001::1)
-l <lifetime>               = interest lifetime in milliseconds (default 500ms)
-V                          = verbose, prints statistics about the messagges sent and received (default false)
-D                          = dump, dumps sent and received packets (default false)
-q                          = quiet, not prints (default false)
-H                          = help
```

### hiperf ###

The command `hiperf` is a  tool for performing network throughput measurements with hicn. It can be executed as server or client using the following options:

```
usage: hiperf [-S|-C] [options] [prefix|name]

Options:
-D                          = run as a daemon
-R                          = run RTC protocol (client or server)
-f <ouptup_log_file>        = output log file path

Server specific:
-A <download_size>          = size of the content to publish. This is not the size of the packet (see -s for it)
-s <payload_size>           = size of the payload of each data packet
-r                          = produce real content of content_size bytes
-m                          = produce transport manifest
-l                          = start producing content upon the reception of the first interest
-k <keystore_path>          = path of p12 file containing the crypto material used for signing the packets
-y <hash_algorithm>         = use the selected hash algorithm for calculating manifest digests
-p <password>               = password for p12 keystore
-x                          = produce a content of <download_size>, then after downloading it produce a new content of
					          <download_size> without resetting the suffix to 0
-B	<bitrate>			    = bitrate for RTC producer, to be used with the -R option

Client specific:
-b <beta_parameter>         = RAAQM beta parameter
-d <drop_factor_parameter>  = RAAQM drop factor parameter
-M                          = store the content downloaded (default false)
-W <window_size>            = use a fixed congestion window for retrieving the data
-c <certificate_path>       = path of the producer certificate to be used for verifying the origin of the packets received
-i <stats_interval>         = show the statistics every <stats_interval> milliseconds
-v                          = Enable verification of received data
```
