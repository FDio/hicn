# Hybrid Information-Centric Networking (hICN)

## Introduction

hicn is an open source implementation of Cisco's hICN. It includes a network stack, that implements
ICN forwarding path in IPv6, and a transport stack that implements two main transport protocols and
a socket API. The transport protocols provide one reliable transport service implementation and a
real-time transport service for audio/video media.

hicn plugin is a VPP plugin that implement hicn packet processing as specified in
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-muscariello-intarea-hicn/. The transport library is used to
implement the hicn host stack and makes use of libmemif as high performance connector between
transport and the network stack. The transport library makes use of VPP binary API to configure the
local namespace (local face management).
