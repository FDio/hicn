# Getting started

## Introduction

hicn is an open source implementation of Cisco's hICN. It includes a network stack, that implements
ICN forwarding path in IPv6, and a transport stack that implements two main transport protocols and
a socket API. The transport protocols provide one reliable transport service implementaton and a
real-time transport service for audio/video media.

hicn plugin is a VPP plugin that implement hicn packet processing as specified in
<https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-muscariello-intarea-hicn/.> The transport library is used to
implement the hicn host stack and makes use of libmemif as high performance connector between
transport and the network stack. The transport library makes use of VPP binary API to configure the
local namespace (local face management).

## Release note

The current master branch provides the latest release which is compatible with the lates VPP stable.
No other VPP releases are supported nor maintained. At every new VPP release distribution hicn
master branch is updated to work with the latest stable release. All previous stable releases
are discontinued and not maintained. The user who is interested in a specific release can always
checkout the rigth code tree by searching the latest commit under a given git tag carrying the
release version.

The Hybrid ICN software distribution can be installed for several platforms.
The network stack comes in two different implementations: one scalable based
on VPP and one portable based on IPC and sockets.

The transport stack is a unique library that is used for both the scalable
and portable network stacks.
