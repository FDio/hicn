Hybrid Information-Centric Networking
=====================================

Hybrid Information-Centric Networking (hICN) is a network architecture that makes
use of IPv6 or IPv4 to realize location-independent communications. It is largely
inspired by the pioneer work of Van Jacobson on Content-Centric Networking, that was
a clean-slate architecture whereas hICN is based on the Internet protocol and easy to
deploy in today networks and applications. hICN brings many-to-many communications,
multi-homing, multi-path, multi-source, group communications to the Internet protocol
without replicated unicast. The project implements novel transport protocols, with a socket API,
for real-time and capacity seeking applications. A scalable stack is available based
on VPP and a client stack is provided to support any mobile and desktop operating system.
