## Executables ##

The application examples are a set of binary executables that are used to run a simple http client (higet) and a simple http server (hicn-http-server).

### higet ###

The command `higet` runs the higet application. higet can be executed
with the following options:

```
higet [option]... [url]...

-S                          = print server response
```

### hicn-http-server ###

`hicn-http-server` is a web server able to publish content and generate http responses over TCP/HICN
The command can be executed in the following way:

```
hicn-http-server [OPTIONS]

Options:
-p <root_folder_path>       = path to root folder
-f <coniguration_path>      = configuration file path
-o <tcp_port>               = tcp listener port
-l <webserver_prefix>       = webserver prefix
