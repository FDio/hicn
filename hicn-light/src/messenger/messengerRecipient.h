/**
 * @file messengerRecipient.h
 * @brief A recipient represents the entity that will recieve a Missive from the
 * Messenger.
 *
 * A recipient is identified by the pair (contenxt, callback).  The context is
 * the recipients context, such as it's object pointer.  The callback is the
 * function the recipient uses to receive a Missive.
 *
 * If the receiver is going to do a lot of work or potentially send other
 * missives, the receiver should queue the received notifications and process
 * them in its own slice.
 *
 * A recipient will receive a reference counted copy of the missive, so it must
 * call
 * {@link missive_Release} on it.
