 * @abstract Forwarding strategy implementation
 * @constant receiveObject is called when we receive an object and have a
 * measured round trip time.  This allows a strategy to update its performance
 * data.
 * @constant lookupNexthop Find the set of nexthops to use for the Interest.
 *           May be empty, should not be NULL.  Must be destroyed.
 * @constant addNexthop Add a nexthop to the list of available nexthops with a
 * routing protocol-specific cost.
 * @constant destroy cleans up the strategy, freeing all memory and state.  A
 * strategy is reference counted, so the final destruction only happens after
 * the last reference is released.
