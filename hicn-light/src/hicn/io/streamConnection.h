 *   We are the "client side" of the stream connection.  We'll create state for
 * the peer, but it will be in the "down" state until the connection
 * establishes.
 *
 *   For TCP, both address pairs need to be the same address family: both INET
 * or both INET6.  The remote address must have the complete socket information
 * (address, port).  The local socket could be wildcarded or may specify down to
 * the (address, port) pair.
 *
 *   If the local address is IPADDR_ANY and the port is 0, then it is a normal
 * call to "connect" that will use whatever local IP address and whatever local
 * port for the connection.  If either the address or port is set, the local
 * socket will first be bound (via bind(2)), and then call connect().
 *
 *   AF_UNIX is not yet supported
 *
 *   If there's an error binding to the specified address or connecting to the
 * remote address, will return NULL.
 *
 * @param pair (takes ownership of this) is the complete socket pair of
 * (address, port) for each end, if INET or INET6.
 * @return NULL on error, otherwise the connections IO operations.
