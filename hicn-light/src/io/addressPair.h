 *    `addressPair_Equals(x, y)` must return true if and only if
 *        `addressPair_Equals(y, x)` returns true.
 *
 *  * It is transitive: for any non-null reference values x, y, and z, if
 *        `addressPair_Equals(x, y)` returns true and
 *        `addressPair_Equals(y, z)` returns true,
 *        then  `addressPair_Equals(x, z)` must return true.
 *
 *  * It is consistent: for any non-null reference values x and y, multiple
 *      invocations of `addressPair_Equals(x, y)` consistently return true or
 *      consistently return false.
 *
 *  * For any non-null reference value x, `addressPair_Equals(x, NULL)` must
