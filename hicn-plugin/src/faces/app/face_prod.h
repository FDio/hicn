/**
 * @file
 *
 * @brief Producer application face.
 *
 * A producer application face is built upon an ip face and identify a local
 * producer application (co-located with the forwarder) that acts as a producer. In the
 * current design an application face is either a face towards a consumer face
 * or towards a producer. The interface used by the producer application face is
 * assumed to be reserved only for hICN traffic (e.g.,  dedicated memif that
 * connects the applictation to the forwarder). Only one application face can be
 * assigned to an interface.
 *
 * To each producer application face it is assigned a portion of the CS. Every
 * data arriving to a producer application will be stored in the portion of the
 * CS assigned to the face. The eviction policy is defined in the
 * face. Available eviction faces are list in the /cache_policy folder.
 *
 * In the vlib graph a producer application face is directly connected to the
 * device-input node (with the node hicn-face-prod-input) and passes every packet to
 * the hicn-face-ip node.
