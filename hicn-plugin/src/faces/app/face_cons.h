 *
 * A consumer application face is built upon an ip face and identify a local
 * consumer application (co-located with the forwarder) that acts as a
 * consumer. The interface used by the consumer application face is
 * assumed to be reserved only for hICN traffic (e.g.,  dedicated memif that
 * connects the applictation to the forwarder). Only one application face can be
 * assigned to an interface.
 *
 * In the vlib graph a consumer application face directly connect the
 * device-input node to the hicn-vface-ip node.
