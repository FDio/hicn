/**
 * @file pg.h
 *
 * The packet generator is made of two entities, a client and a server.
 * The client issues interests at high speed and the server satisfy each
 * interest it receives with the corresponding data.
 * The packet generator is made of three nodes:
 * - hicnpg-interest that receives packets from a packet generator interface
 *   and manipulate them to generate interests based on the given configuration.
 *   This node runs at the client side.
 * - hicnpg-data that receives data packets at the client side and counts them.
 *   This is useful for statistics. The "show err" command will give the number
 *   of interest issued and data received at the client side
 * - hicnpg-server that recevies and interest and replies with the corresponding
 *   data. The data is generated from the interest switching the src and destination
 *   address in the packet and appending a payload to the packet.
 *
 *
 * These three nodes are inserted in the vlib graph in the following manner:
 * - hicnpg-interest is added as a possible next node of the pg-input node. The packet
 *   generator stream then specifies it as next node.
 * - hicnpg-data is added as next hop of the ip4/6-unicast node exploiting the corresponding
 *   feature and it runs before the ip4/6-inacl node. In this way, every packet that is
 *   received through an interface on which this feature is enabled is sent to this node.
 * - hicnpg-server is added as next hop of the ip4/6-unicast using the corresponding
 *   feature and it runs before the ip4/6-inacl node. In this way, every packet that is
 *   received through an interface on which this feature is enabled is sent to this node.
 *
 * An example of how to use the pg for hicn is available in the documentation.
